# Football-Outcome-Predictions

> A thorough investigation into the world of Football using Data Science. This project uses Machine Learning and other Data Science techniques for the aim of effectively predicting the outcome of football matches from the biggest leagues in the world.

## EDA and Data Cleaning
The use of pandas and data visualisation libraries such as seaborn can quickly give great insight into data being investigated... From given features in data, new features can be theorised and brainstormed for implementation during Feature Engineering stage...

Check for null values...

Examples of plots used to get insight (data visualisation)...

## Feature Engineering
Further using pandas and basic Python, creating pipeline generating all features that may have useful insight during learning process. From the EDA and Data Cleaning, potential features were outlined and generated.

Pipeline useful as can quickly change what league and year results table to extrapolate data from...
